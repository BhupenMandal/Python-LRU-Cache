## Description
To maintain the time and space complexity of O(1), I believed that using OrderedDict() structure was necessary. 
This type of Dictionary has methods which makes moving data inside the Dictionary easier and more efficient compared to the traditional dictionary. 
Since the amount of data doesn’t matter as increase in data wouldn’t affect the efficiency of the code, both Time and Space complexity would maintain a Big O(1). 
Also, the Get and Set operations will run in constant time.
